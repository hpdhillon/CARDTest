good morning and welcome to ask Dr Doreen Im Shannon Penrod and Dr Doreen

Grampy Shea is here with us good morning good morning Im so excited to be here with you this morning uh and were were

live right now I should say that it is Tuesday December th and Dr Grampy Shea is live right now because I know many of

you watch and you want to know when were live as opposed to reruns but were live live live right now in fact

were saying good morning to Liliana and to Renee and Elvira uh so thrilled that

you guys are here with us so Dr Grampy Shay good morning good morning Shannon good morning everyone its lovely to be

here well its lovely to be here with you and for those of you who dont know Dr Grampy Shay is a true expert in the field of autism shes been working in

this field for more than  years I just that that like it doesnt make sense its never made sense to me and every

time it gets a little bit more it makes less sense to me but shes been working in the field for more than  I said

four zero years working with all kinds of individuals on the autism spectrum from very young babies up through senior

citizens and everything in between at all different levels I find her absolutely remarkable and somewhat of a

unicorn in that while she is a a behaviorist you know youre a PhD bcbad

right and I get all the letters in there um but she also uh and I think sort of

it makes great sense to me but I think it is you are a unicorn that you are a humanitarian well thank you in that

youre always doing perspective taking about what it is like for the individuals on the Spectrum right what

it is like for the people who love them around them and supporting all of them you have been for years way before it

was the popular thing been at the Forefront of saying if youre going to work with someone on the Spectrum it has

to be worthwhile for them my favorite phrase that you say is it has to be fair fair yeah yeah um and that you know

resonates so deeply with me as a parent um and I obviously you know you guys

know if you watch the show know that my son is doing remarkably well and that I credit Dr Grampy Shea and her knowledge

and what you taught to the people who worked with him on a daytoday basis is the reason why my son is doing so well

so Im her biggest fan I know some of you are right there with me like shoulder to shoulder with that but I

know nobody loves her more than I do you know obviously your husband and your kids Ill Ill concede to them thank you

but we hope I think I know all of them and they do but uh were saying good

morning to Susie B and were looking forward to seeing you later on today and

uh were thrilled that you guys are here with us live we are live were taking your questions live right now on

Facebook YouTube Twitter and about a dozen other sites trayvons going to show those on the screen to you hes

been showing them to you I want to remind all of you that um we love it when you subscribe and

there are different ways of subscribing if youre on the autism hyphen live site which is still very functional there is

a place there to subscribe to a mailing list the easier one the better one the

faster one is when you are on autismnetworkcom there is a sick after youre on for about six seconds a popup

pops up and you either have to exit or you know or you do decide that youre

going to subscribe that instantly goes on to the mailing list the other one I have to do by hand oh I see it so then

youre then youre having to deal with how slow I am but um then weve started the newsletters again we had suspended

those during the pandemic but weve started the newsletters again and Im really proud of the fact that when you open our newsletters you get coupons

codes for money off of some really amazing toys Im in love with this Mosey

thing you guys um because look you know you sit and hold hands with your kid and then you

pass this back and forth oh how cool I am like ridiculously fond of this is fun

yeah its better if youre closer to each other and then you can manipulate it a little more but so fun and you can

play all kinds of games with this because it pops up into a ball and you can do all kinds of things with it uh

Trayvon and I had such a good time with this the other day and he was saying I dont know how to get it back to the thing and I said theres this moment

when you think itll never oh no its like the slinky gone awry and itll never go back and I said you know you

stick your finger in and theres always a moment where you go its not going to work its not going to work and then it snaps that to me is sort of fascinating

but anyway um so I dont know how I got off what is this called thats called the mosey okay

and its its they say you just Mosey along with it Im gonna need one for my I know thats why thats why I got it

out thats why I got it out uh and I have many other choice uh speaking of which you guys if you havent already if

youre interested in toys and and you should get the newsletter because there it was theres a five percent off code

for this right now yeah and anything else that fun in motion toys does there

was also a five percent code off of the um uh smart felt toys too which are great

for developing speech so all of those things are part and parcel of our toy

guide which is available right now on the website if you go to autismnetworkcom click on the toy guide

if you hold down on that two things will happen if you if you hold down for a while itll take you directly to a site

where you can choose all the age ranges or theres a drop down menu if you want to just you know that youre looking for

something for a baby then you can just click on the baby and go there I always like to say to people start with the age

of the the individual but then look in every other category because you know what category this is in its in the

caregiver category oh interesting because I put it in um for the cat the caregiver sensory because its a way for

a caregiver to make a connection with their child but this could be in the school age category it could be between

adult yeah so theres lots of toys like that that would fit in other categories so do look around and dont forget sad

that this Sunday is our th Annual sensitive Santa oh my gosh I know that

came up fast I know its its really my favorite day of the year you guys and were working so hard here to get

everything ready for those of you whove already registered weve got you and were so excited about you coming we

hope that you arrive on time its at the Ed Asner Family Center and it is a drivethrough yeah

um but you do have the choice this year to get out of your car and take a quick picture with Santa Claus thats socially

distance nice and next year maybe we can do just in person thats what were hoping for I mean but were still an

abundance of caution but if you have not gotten your tickets were almost sold out you guys but there are a few more

tickets in a couple of different time ranges you want to go to Eventbrite and go to sensitive Santa event  and you

will find us and then you can register the tickets are free but you cannot come without a ticket because we have to know

whos coming of course for toys it gets very busy see the elves are hard

at work they are and I wish the cameras could see all the elves working over here yeah you know turban showed the the

he had a camera set up the other day so that it would show and I said you showed the mess I mean our studio and our

offices are just packed with toys it looks like Santa has exploded but I love that hello Dark Angel and hello our

journey Camerons new life were so glad that youre all here this morning so the topic the starting topic this morning is

Tantrums right which I know everybody is you know pretty common yeah yeah

um and our first question this morning is help how do I deal with my sons Tantrums I feel like no matter what I do
Help How do I deal with my sons tantrums I feel like no matter what I do it is wrong in someones eyes I am terrified to go out anymore because I am afraid he will have a tantrum and I wont be able to know what to do

its wrong in someones eyes Im terrified to go out anymore because Im afraid he will have a tantrum and I

wont be able to know what to do yeah which I think is a lot of how weve all felt I thought absolutely on a certain

day yeah yeah and I often you know right now Im trying to write some stuff about how to deal with challenging behaviors

and I dont know prepare parents and I love the feedback and the opportunity actually right now to ask a lot of

parents I dont know if its you know on the one hand I think a lot of parents just want to know right away like if I

have a tantrum the Tantrum how do I deal with that yeah on the other hand I know a lot of parents just in general want to

know like what is the basis of of dealing with all challenging behaviors right and I dont know which one is

easier to explain its the same thing but so Ill try to kind of give a little bit of a general answer which might help

will help with not just Tantrums but might help also with in general any

behavior that has challenged any Behavior period right so it starts with

the idea of everything we do has a purpose so when our child Tantrums its our job

to try to figure out what the purpose is and in ABA lingo we call that the

function and it doesnt mean anything other than the purpose the reason why is

the child doing that and often when we do something its the purpose of it is

because were trying to communicate something right so I might you might

have that toy and I might want that toy now in order to get that toy I might hit

you I might grab it I might run up to Mom and cry I might Ill whatever

Behavior I have all of those behaviors are not acceptable really except for me

asking you nicely and waiting for you to share it so theres always an

appropriate way to get what we want and then a whole bunch of not acceptable

ways right and thats true of everyone its not just our kids its true of us right if we want lets say more

attention from our spouse we might do a bunch of nonadaptive things you know

like I dont know throw a fit at home demand their time be rude but whatever

or we might ask in a very good adaptive fashion so our job is to figure out when

our kids do a certain Behavior why are they doing it and and I always like to use the the easier way for parents I

think is to say if they had really good language and they had already learned

this how what would they be communicating instead of throwing the

Tantrum what would they be saying and it is always going to be

some expression of something they want or dont want thats always the case

believe me so its always going to be I want some object I want some activity I

want some food I want your attention I want what he has I want something I want

to go to the bathroom I want to go to the bathroom I want medication because I have pain whatever I want to break I

want to break thats very which I want to break starts us into the category of

stuff I dont want which is I dont want to work anymore right I dont want to be doing this I dont want to have to

answer your question I dont want to pay attention I dont want to stop selfstimulating I dont want so its

always something I want or I dont want okay and the hard part is not dealing

with the Tantrum the hard part is figuring out what is it theyre trying to communicate thats the hard part

getting that function right is so so so vital and thats what all of ABA is

about with ABA you figure out what it is they want or dont want and then you

teach them to use a more adaptive functional appropriate way of requesting

that thing and you do not allow the nonadaptive challenging way to win its

its really that simple so when your child Tantrums whatever you figure out first of all what what they want and by

the way every tantrum is going to be a different thing so there the the thing

about it is that when our kids tantrum and they get in one scenario they get

what they want so for instance you try to get your child to hurry up and get ready and its time to go out and they

have a tantrum and by tantruming theyre going getting ready and going out is delayed right so they get out of so they

get to avoid so if they could talk they would have said I dont want to go out I

dont I just want to keep doing what Im doing and so they by tantruming theyve accomplished that now in their system in

their mind that tantrum becomes a powerful Communicator so now theyve learned oh Im going from now on when I

dont want something I will tantrum yeah and its going to work so be careful

because every single time that your child Tantrums it could have a different function so they could be wanting to not

go out they could be wanting to continue playing with this toy they could they could tantrum because theyre trying to

get your attention because you havent been attending to them they could tantrum because they dont want to go to

school whatever it is right once youve figured out that function now the key

part of it is to not allow them to receive that thing when they tantrum

but to allow them to receive that thing that they wanted when they ask in a more

appropriate way and so that means if Im tantruming because I dont want to go to

school sorry Im going to get you ready and take you to school anyway but if you

say Mom I really dont want to go to school today then I will probably maybe give you a break or maybe go with you or

do I will respond to what it is that you really want if you ask for it nicely so

Im going to now take that down to the level of lets say a child whos not able to communicate really well right so

lets say a young child a threeyearold cant really say I want that toy you

have right now so theyre hitting you to grab that toy or theyre having a

tantrum because they couldnt have that toy now its for us what we do as

behaviorists is if theyre tantruming and we know its because they want that toy we do not give the toy when the

child is tantruming instead we will prompt the child to say toy or to point

to the picture of a toy or even for nonvocal children to somehow indicate

in a more appropriate way that thats what they want and whenever they do the more appropriate behavior they get a lot

of Kudos they get the toy they get a break they get all kinds of goodies and whenever they communicated a

nonappropriate way or in a challenging way they do not get what it is they were asking for and that applies to pretty

much everything I want to break if they ask for just a break if they point to a

icon of a break any any appropriate way of of asking for a break they get a

break but if theyre tantruming and throwing a fit and all that sort of stuff no you continue to work through it

you just continue to work until the Tantrum subsides and the child says break and then you can give them a break

so thats how you deal with Tantrums now in this particular case I think the parents said whenever we go out yeah

right yeah and so you have to figure out what it is about going out it could be

so many different things it could be the place youre going that the child doesnt want to go to that place which

by the way its not like you always will have to avoid that place its just that you need to better prepare your child

for going to that place it could be they dont want to go in the car they dont

like the car it could be they dont want to get ready it could be they dont want to give up what it is theyre giving up

in order to go out it could be a million different things but you have to figure that out without figuring that out

youre not going to know what it is it could also be that theyre fine until you get to the

place so its not really about going out its about something in that place so it could be overwhelming because its too

noisy its too stimulating and theres too many people theres lights and

sounds you think about what it is thats the key to figuring out how to deal with

it and all of that is such good information but I think Renee and Elvira has really hit on the thing here they

say during Tantrums slash meltdowns I get so emotional and overwhelmed and freeze calming myself first is big thing

for me and I think thats for a lot of us thats for all of us thats for all of us let me tell you I always make fun
During tantrumsmeltdowns I get so emotional and overwhelmed and freeze  calming myself first is big thing for me

of this because you know Ive like been doing ABA and some form of Behavioral psychology my whole life pretty much

well on and it was pretty easy with my first child and my second child all of

this worked right that was my third child there was nothing on Earth that I

could do to get this child sometimes to either calm down go to sleep whatever it

is and believe me as a behaviorist whos been practicing and writing about this stuff forever I would sit outside her

room crying because Id be like oh my God what am I doing wrong and so this is

a very very normal thing which is why its helpful to have if you have access

to a bcba a boardcertified behavior analyst or someone with that level of experience and knowledge to sit down

with you and say I know youre you are emotional right now but the reason hes doing this is this and theres a lot of

ways that bcbas we figure out what that function or purpose is yeah because you

we change the scenario multiple times and we realize is oh every time were

going to Chuck E cheese he has some help down so its got to be something with Chuck E cheese we narrow it down and we

figure out the appropriate purpose I you know I I dont want to say something

thats you know blanket but I think there have been a lot of studies suggesting that parents of special needs

kids have PTSD oh for sure and I I feel that a lot of us do and you know for me

gem had a lot of Tantrums but the one the mother of all Tantrums that I remember the most was when we were at a

McDonalds yeah and it was one of those ones that had the play structure thing and I took him there and and he was

going to get to be there for quite a while it wasnt like he only got to be there for  minutes but it was one of those that I would be so anxious the

whole time because he would be up in the tubes and you have no control yeah once theyre up in the tubes and you know

like youre gonna go in there after them right my fat took us in the you know I could just like like I was like oh my

gosh Im gonna get stuck in there and theyre gonna have to call the parent addicts and you know my kid is good but but you know you worry about because I

mean kids will bite other kids up there yeah you worry is your child going to do something to another child or is another

child going to do something to you and sometimes theres older kids up there like everything under the sun right and

so I would sit there and be watching through the tubes the whole time and be at a heightened place myself anyway and

then I would try to give him the countdown and say okay were leaving in five minutes you know and not

um but he got to a point where he understood that he was in control yeah and that I and I could say you know

youve got  seconds to come down and he you know he didnt have the ability to give me the finger but he essentially

did I mean yeah right and and So eventually he came down I dont know how

I lured him down but I said we have to leave right now and he through the mother of all Tantrums I had to pick him

up he was clawing and biting and kicking and hitting and

I just remember going out the side door yeah and the entire place was staring at

us and he was holding on to the door as I was trying to peel his fingers off as he was kicking me in the head uh you

know I think I had him upside down carrying him to the car and and I felt

like two cents yeah I felt like okay I traumatized my child Im a bad parent oh

everybody in there thinks Im a bad parent I dont have control I dont feel proficient and then I do I wouldnt I

the the terrible thing was that it was probably you know I dont know that I ever brought him back to a McDonalds I

think we went to other play structures but I went with a therapist yeah because I didnt so I understand this parent

saying I dont want to go out because I totally totally but I but I will tell

you that now and Im gonna get emotional in my life there came a point when I

felt proficient enough I mean obviously now my son is just such a joy way in a treat to be around and I it never

crosses my mind to be concerned about his behavior not ever ever of course but its been that way for years but I

remember a time when he was like I dont know  or  where I realized oh Im no

longer afraid that my child will have a tantrum yeah yeah and it was such a a

relief and a release and I felt competent that if something happened like I see that in you that you know a

child comes into your circle and and I see competence and that you know youre

going to be able to handle it no matter what right but when youre in the thick of it oh God I know its so hard to know

I know will I ever be proficient enough that I feel confident with my child and

thats devastating to opinion but Shannon thats the and believe me I know

this experience like I do know this experience and thats where my my the

sentence that I always say that you quote so which is is it fair thats where that comes in because if the

scenario is made fair for the child not only will the child be more manageable

and compliant but you wont feel so much guilt about it the whole thing works when its fair and so a lot of times

like we have to question our own rules which is kind of like you know I and we

have so many of these rules you think about it like oh I have to go to

McDonalds because thats where people take their kids to play on the play structures thats not true that is not

true for your child that could necessarily its not necessarily the right place to go at that time hes not

prepared perhaps you have to do a bunch of preparation before you approach that

theres so much stuff like that you know like so I think instead of like going there and having

that kind of an experience where it becomes so traumatic my recommendation

is to really try to do this in steps in very small steps where you can make sure

that you go out to a location get help first of all be prepared read as much as

you can about how to manage these types of behaviors always think in terms of your what is your child thinking right

now like and this is another thing any other child would also have a problem with leaving a preferred any other child

but theres a difference the difference is when you tell the other child hey

were going to come back tomorrow right they have a concept of that they have a concept of oh were coming back at some

future point and they also have this desire to not make you too mad yeah and

our kids dont necessarily recognize oh what Im doing doing right now is going to really upset my mom and they also

dont have the concept of time if there was a way where you could give your child a timer and that said when this

timer goes off well be back here I promise you every child has the capacity to wait they just dont they think

youre taking them away forever yeah and also the other part of it is they become

hyper stimulated to the point where they cant control themselves theyve now

lost all control because and I was already in a state and youre already in this thing because I was worried the

whole time but I think that one of the things that really helped me that you

guys did for me was that you gave me a job during the Tantrum yeah and and my

you gave me things like like drop down menus to be thinking about okay you know that the first thing when he would start

to throw like first of all you gave me a job before if I saw it begin to escalate or there was so much control in that

yeah that I that I had things that you you guys had given me that I could choose from to say that like you know to

ask myself the question what is it I think is going on right here is there anything extra going on what do I think

he wants is there a way that I can prompt him to ask for it appropriately right like all of these things that I

could do when I saw it give it to him right what will happen even the preparation of what will happen when

this activity has to end right how am I going to manage that right oh exactly and to have something to say you know

not just say okay I need you to come down in five minutes but to say okay we got five minutes and then were gonna go

do and have that be a preferred activity so that he was willing to disengage that fair thing but but then if the Tantrum

if we got to the Tantrum and the Tantrum happened that then my job shifted that the first thing I needed to do was make

sure that he was safe that I was safe that all the stuff and the people around were safe that gave me something to do

yeah and then to to become like a court reporter yeah to be thinking about how

am I going to describe this to my team later on okay the Tantrum started at   and the first thing that he did was

he threw stuff and I have to tell you guys that helped me to manage the anxiety it helped me to feel capable it

helped me because I was doing I was like oh the tantrums already happening I dont want to be giving it attention so

I have a job right now and Im going to do it because thats going to help us to crack the code on why this is happening

later on right um and that was super you know in a way it reminded me of an acting exercise

that I remember being a young actor and saying I dont understand like I can

bring up tears to cry but I dont understand how Im safe during that time yes and an acting teacher taught me you

know youre in a safe space here and all this other stuff is happening here yeah and and thats what I started to do

during the Tantrums Im safe hes safe I made sure of that now I can be here and

just notice whats happening yeah and so that I can tell it to somebody later on and that helped me to deal with the

anxiety of it but I always used to Marvel theres a video that you show sometimes when you speak uh its from

Americas Funniest Home Videos oh yeah and its I love that video right and um

but its a kid who is a baby its like a oneyearold yeah and I love that video its just when I first saw it on

Americas Funniest Home Videos I was like oh my God I will describe it for them but then I want to tell you what

made me feel yeah so its a baby is in diapers its like a oneyearold whos

just its a toddler is just basically walking and um I guess Mom or Dad is recording this

toddler and they want something or whatever and they throw themselves on the floor and they start screaming and

crying and the person who has the cameras the parent walks to another room

and then you see the baby the toddler looking

stopping getting up and going to the room where the parents on the video is

and then throwing themselves again on the floor and starting the Tantrum again and the parent does this four times they

go to another room and the pet toddler stops goes follows them four times so it

is such a great example of Im only doing this for your pleasure for you to

see that I need something yes but I think whats interesting about it is that the first time I saw it I was

like oh my gosh because you can hear the parent laughing as theyre videotaping and I thought this is the difference

between parents of of kids with autism and neurotypical parents because that

parent knows this is not going to be the rest of the life their life that parent knows this is a tantrum and this is just

a phase that theyre going through and its not going to be the rest of our lives this is why and whenever I talk to

parents on the Spectrum I say videotape a lot even when you dont want to because youre going to need to go back

and look at what you got through but we dont want to because we think its the rest of our lives well we literally

stand there in that moment and think this is never going to end thats so true and I hadnt thought about that

thats something new that you just taught me really absolutely but the other side of it I think Shannon is also

theres a lot of embarrassment with parents with special needs kids because they feel being judged they feel like

others are judging me at this thats right we are being looked down

upon yes and we need to stop this the amount of stuff that goes on in this

minute just the emotions your emotions its a lot its a lot which is why often

when you say like you know they taught me a stepbystep guide yeah its so important to try to not really judge

yourself at that moment right or your child but remember that this is behavior

and behavior occurs in all of us in the same way its not about autism at all

and I want to keep repeating that a lot of times people think Tantrums challenging Behavior blah blah blah all

any challenging Behavior has nothing to do with the diagnosis of autism this is

so important it is not one of the symptoms of autism it is a side effect

of not being able to communicate now thats super important because a lot of

times when our kids are diagnosed people will say oh that explains why he has so many tantrums and then it becomes an

acceptable part of autism its not its not one of the symptoms of autism it is

just like any other communication disability where if you cant communicate you will tantrum because

challenging behaviors are a form of communication theyre a form of I cant

tell you otherwise whats going on with me so Im going to tantrum which is why

by the way typically developing kids they tantrum as well when theyre young as time goes on language replaces that

and thats thats really the key to it that is so critical for us to remember because its its not youre not a bad

parent yeah right this child did not come out of the womb with an instruction manual sorry I wish I did but they

didnt yeah and there are techniques that you can learn that will Empower you um but the I I really have an allergic

reaction when Im someplace with older um children on the spectrum that are

like   years old and theyre behaving like really inappropriately and the parents just go thats autism and I

I have an allergic reaction to that thats not the ticket but lets get to some of these questions that people have

written in Parker says heres a question I want to ask its not for me but Im curious about it and I love this

question Parker for example a kids special interest is PAW Patrol and its all over the Christmas list and the
Age Appropriate Toys

therapist or another person says he needs a new ageappropriate interest and there was no par Paw Patrol under the

tree I heard about a similar story with Shannon it was actually Nancy that went through that with Thomas the Tank I

would like to hear that story and how to handle a situation like that Im asking out of curiosity and helping other

people yeah so I always talk about theres you know

there are lots of decisions we have to make when were working with our kids

one decision is do I want to have do I want to give my the child in this

particular instance something of significant interest that means a powerful reinforcer or do I want them to

have something ageappropriate and and theres a good reason behind both of those so do I want something thats a

powerful reinforcer my God theres like a million reasons why we would want a powerful reinforcer right like most of

the time in ABA were actually seeking out those powerful reinforcers because theyre the only thing we have in order

to teach your child if you dont have a powerful reinforcer for a child you cant teach them period because they

will find other reinforcers right but when you have a powerful reinforcer like that Paw Patrol and you want to teach

your child something difficult it comes in very useful very handy so thats one reason for that the reason for Asia

program appropriate is when youre at the point where you want to increase social skills with other children peers

and if youre the work if youre playing with Paw Patrol but youre not playing with something that is more

ageappropriate your peers will not be attracted to engaging with you and that

is the only reason so you can have both you can have PAW Patrol as the powerful

reinforcer but when it comes to Pure interaction youre going to want to have

some things that are more ageappropriate these things we have to remember the ageappropriate things are

not reinforcers for that particular child their their work their work and

thats okay because once he has engaged with his peers using the appropriate

toys he can have a Time on his own plane watching Paw Patrol and thats you know

its true for a lot of us I was actually saw an old friend of mine yesterday and its funny because sometimes when I see

friends who are my age and weve known each other for a long long time we have

were very honest and transparent and we talk about how like social socializing

is doesnt have the same reinforcement value as it did when we were in our s right when youre in your s all you

really want to do is just chill and not do anything right and so social behavior

which would be the power the pure appropriate play the ageappropriate play is not a reinforcer for us anymore

in fact you kind of force yourself to go out its a its a job oh yeah and after

that you can have your Paw Patrol which is laying in bed and watching whatever it is you want to watch so you just have

to you have to have both they have different reasons and you figure out which one is appropriate for that time I

I always say I want to like write a book that is uh translating parent to bcba

and bcba to parent um because I feel like everybody gets so black and white about this oh yeah yeah

this is a really good point and thanks for saying that because I have seen a lot of in fact I engage with a lot of

vcbas who do this and they are like no no no we cant let him play with this because its not ageappropriate they

forget that it doesnt matter its a reinforcer yeah the things that are

reinforcers dont have to be age appropriate or in any way appropriate as

long as theyre reinforcers thats very important and on the parent side we go and we ask the the team and say you know

what kinds of things should I get my child and when they say oh yeah I dont get the PAW Patrol we think that means

no PAW Patrol right whatsoever right whereas I wish Id like to insert myself into the conversation and say what kinds

of skills would you like your child to be working on heres the the list of toys that would be good for them that

are ageappropriate and well work with them you know to do that and from the parent side you know that they that they

could be saying hey you know I I know that the PAW Patrol thing isnt very

ageappropriate but how could we take that and make it more ageappropriate like how could we work towards that like

so now theres one Paw Patrol toy thats the Paw Patrol toy but then we have uh

uh you know a drawing pad where were going to learn how to draw Paw Patrol you can take a lot of stuff like that

youre right or Thomas the Tank Engine that you know okay so they were gonna get one Thomas the Tank toy but now

were also gonna get them a train set thats the ho thats a little bit older or were gonna get them a book about

real trains yes or were going to take them to Travel Town where they have real old trains okay so and you bring up a

whole nother point because you pointed out when Nancy was talking about Wyatt and how some of these things that are

reinforcers I I want to say two other things about things that are powerfully reinforcing one is that they can become

obsessive yes thats a different issue that is not the issue were talking about here its a different issue they

dont always have to become obsessive if you can control them but they can become

obsessive when something becomes obsessive now its part of the behavioral program to get you out of

that Obsession which by the way also doesnt happen forcefully it happens gradually because

when we when we have obsessions theres a reason for those as well theyre not

just oh this is part of the autism no the reason we have things that are obsessive compulsive is because we have

anxiety and these things give us a sense of control over our environments they

are familiar there theres something about different things that gives us a sense of control so obsessions as a

whole have to be taken away gradually or reduced gradually otherwise our anxiety

will shoot through the roof so thats an important thing to remember but the other part of it Shannon is like you

know everything like a lot of parents will ask me you know his biggest dream so like Ill Ill start with what are

some reinforcers thats like the most important thing you cannot do any kind of Behavioral you cant do any kind of

intervention unless you know what are the rewards right so what are the reinforcers and parents will have a hard time list testing them yeah and Ill be

like well what about like an iPad or playing on and theyll say oh yeah he loves the iPad but were not really

allowed to give that to him thats not the case that is whats really important to realize you can give any kind of

reinforcer as long as it is controlled so its not all day long every day yeah

and as long as its not harmful and the reason I say harmful is because as

children there are certain things that are harmful for instance sugar sugar as

adults theres a ton of reinforcers that we sometimes give ourselves that are

harmful such as alcohol alcohol is a very harmful reinforcer that a lot of

people use such as shopping such as gambling these are all harmful

reinforcers and we dont want our kids to learn harmful habits so you start

with teaching them you can have any reinforcer as long as its not harmful

and its not obsessive it doesnt take up your whole day right and thats it that is the key to it and and you know

so any kind of reinforcer is fine and then you know but but to Parkers point if youve if youve carried it out to

the the nth degree which people do because we we go we want to listen and we dont hear all the Nuance to it and

so when people do you know when there is Disappointment because something is not under the tree how do you deal with that

yeah and I mean disappointment is a different issue the way I would deal

with it is I would make sure there are some things under the tree I agree that are Pleasant for the child I mean

remember the whole purpose of Christmas or whatever youre celebrating right is

that youre its a day when you are giving your child free reinforcers right

I mean thats what this is about right so I would make sure there are things that are interesting because

realistically putting stuff under the tree that the child has no interest in is like for a typically developing child

buying them stuff they dont like right so why would you do that you know no absolutely uh okay uh our cam our

journey Camerons New Life comments that uh their son throws things and screams thats communication yeah hes telling

you something uh Yasmine says hello my son  years old went upset at school and sometimes home will curse at the
My son gets upset and curses at teachers at school

teachers or Aid sometimes he will hit and always apologize guys right after they have been trying to teach him what

he can say or do when hes upset he becomes mad when he cant have something or when he has to do something he does

not want to do once he said to the aid Im going to kill you uh when he was mad

yeah so theyre not doing a terrific job at it I mean it maybe they are I dont

know it might take a little bit longer at school yeah but the the concepts

behind that is that saying the words and apologizing is not a good plan thats

just not the intervention that should be apologizing to is not going to be

sufficient and think about that again A lot of times I say that about our own

typical kids and or adults or adults yeah you know if you went around and

just yelled at people and then said Im so sorry and just kept doing it people would not that would not be okay yeah I

mean there are people that do that thats an abusive relationship absolutely yes absolutely absolutely right but so what I the point

here is that especially when they actually can see it starting to happen

they need to have a million different ways for the child to specifically say

Im getting angry Im getting upset I think I need to go outside and cool down

or I think I need a break from this or whatever it is teach them to go in the

corner and take a deep breath I mean I always say its good for our kids to have like a bean bag where they can go

and put on some music and calm down remember it is harder for our kids to selfregulate right its hard for some

of us I mean you know I see myself when I was a child it would take me a while

to cool off whereas Id see lets say another child and they just didnt care so people have different levels of

ability to down regulate and up regulate so remember that it is harder for our

kids they become over stimulated overwhelmed with things and so its

important to catch it before it turns into a cuss word or some sort of yelling

or something and when they recognize that the child is about to get to that point they teach the child something

that he can say or do to remove himself and then come back and its just not

okay when if he does it apology is definitely not enough this is a case where if he does actually occurs they

should be have some sort of token system where a response cost economy is

occurring so he does something he loses a token which would have otherwise

gotten him closer to a reinforcer absolutely why I loved when my son went

to Junior High his guidance counselor gave him a card and it was like a get out of jail free card it was like you

can and his all of his teachers were told if he ever and he said were going to find a place in your backpack where

it lives so you know where it is and if he ever raises this card or says or refers to the card no questions asked he

gets to come to my office yeah like immediately and my son only used it once

in the two years that he was in junior high but it was like really freaking helpful yeah because he had reached a

point where and and you know before that you guys had taught him how

to recognize when he needed to ask for something but that that spoke the language of his school right you know

because he could have said I needed a break and you know theres a math teacher who would be like no its not time for a break right you gotta have a

break exactly but because that was from the guidance counselor everybody knew no no that we dont mess with that I love

that Megan wrote in and said their tantrum is not our fault amen our

failure or our failure yeah yeah and its also not theirs I mean and thats exactly its not theirs either I mean

people theres no question even today like with as much knowledge of autism as

there is people still will judge you when your child screams or cries in a public place who cares like to me its

like I dont you I dont care I dont care sorry too bad you know like this is

Im dealing with something here its not their failure its not your failure its their way of communicating which

unfortunately is not socially appropriate and that actually is one of those really interesting key parts of

why when individuals on the Spectrum say we dont need to be changed I disagree

because its not just an individual on the Spectrum its anyone who exhibits a

tantrum in be in social life is going to need to change because tantruming or

having challenging behaviors amongst others is disruptive to others and no

matter what our diagnosis or no diagnosis we all learn to become more

acclimated to that and become more of a social being and so you know thats the

same thing its nobodys failure its just that theyre taking a little bit longer to learn that this isnt okay and

we all have the right to learn Im glad you wrote this question back in because I actually have it on this piece of

paper they wrote it and said good morning my  year old son is extremely bright has friends hobbies and

participates in sports our problem is when we are in the car and we get stuck in traffic he has a meltdown of crying
My  Year Old Tantrums Every Time we are in Traffic

yelling hyperventilating and internalizing the situation hell say what did I do to deserve this it looks

like a panic attack we have tried a car bag with books fidgets iPad but he wont

touch it he will ask over and over to find out how long the wait will be but sometimes we dont have a cell service

its like he needs information but even if we know even if we know he still

doesnt settle down what can we do traffic is a part of life and thank you so

I dont know why my first instinct is to tell you are you sure that he needs the

information or do you think it is possible that he is enjoying the attention that you give

him when he is panicking so question that ask yourself that

because a lot of times our kids begin to interact in a way where now theyre

getting a lot of parents giving them a way to calm that its okay honey its

all right well be all right its totally fine dont worry itll be this itll be that its a lot of interaction

from you and perhaps thats whats maintaining this Behavior so my first

question and this can be a little tough but my first question is have you what

happens if you dont interact at all and you just play some music give him the

opportunity to put on some headphones or whatever if he chooses to he can if he chooses not to its up to him but

basically carry on a conversation with someone else in the car when you hit

traffic and see what happens and see if he is able to get control of that

anxiety some other way than leaning into you having to calm him because youve

given him a lot of other options but he continues to maintain this one try that

and by the way if it you know its working if it gets worse before it gets

better thats called an Extinction burst whenever something gains attention whenever the function of something is

attention whenever a child does something in order to gain attention and we stop the attention that behavior will

get worse its called an Extinction burst itll get worse and then itll rapidly dissolve and go away and the

reason it gets worse is because from the childs perspective theyre thinking why isnt anybody telling me how much time

is left why isnt anybody interacting with me why isnt anybody giving me more attention right now and then theyll be

like okay so Im gonna like act up a little bit more to get that attention and and once they do and you still dont

give the attention theyre like I better figure something else out out here because I need to kind of engage myself

some other way so that is one possibility is that hes doing it for the attention the other thing is you

know I mean youve done everything honestly youve given him a way of knowing perhaps hes  years old so

perhaps you want to actually show him a map give him maps on the phone and let

him see where it turns orange so theres some predictability so he knows were going to be sitting in traffic for a

little bit and hey isnt this cool we can do all these other things while traffic is happening youve given him a

lot of good things here I like that youve given him like books fidget stuff

iPads but you know if he chooses not to approach that and he chooses to just

engage with you then that tells me its the attention that hes looking for a little bit yeah he sounds like a kid who

might like a GPS watch for Christmas that honestly or just like actually teaching him how to understand whats on

the maps app you know because that helps you and he can actually look at it himself and see that theres  minutes

left in fact if you use maps or ways they both tell you how much time and traffic yeah so and I gotta say too

theres a set of uh headphones in the the toy guide that are called leap pod

Max its from LeapFrog I love these headphones because you can use them with a Bluetooth so they can play their own

music and they theyre kind you know they look like leapfrog and that theyre white and they have green details on

them theyre kind of cool looking um so you could use them for older kids but so you can listen to anything that you want it but also comes

preprogrammed with a bunch of meditation things about breathing and

heres the thing that I love the most about them they are our Factory preset so you cant turn the volume up so hard

that you could hurt your ear yeah which a lot of our kids thats a concern right so I think thats a great thing to have

on board in the car before the traffic right instead of waiting for the traffic

that were going to get in the car and were going to be as in as calm of a state as possible absolutely but

honestly John and I think some of our kids like you know a lot of kids theyre into geography theyre into Maps theyre

into things like traffic so I dont know that in his case its enough to avoid it I

think in fact like just I teach him how to if he wants to know how much more time teach them how to figure that out yeah you know and just you stop talking

about it and you stop trying to calm him I love that but I Do by the way thanks for talking about all these toys because

every toy youre telling about Im like I want a coffee I want that for my kid and I know I know theyre theyre not

thats everybody check out the toy guide why we pick them because theyre really good we havent had a chance this year

because youve been away thats right for you to play with the toys Ill give you a tour of the toys theres some good stuff

um okay uh how to control no reason laughing please guy yeah so you you

should join us when we do a segment or if we have our dear friend Julie

Matthews or some other nutritionist on the on the show with us because no reason laughing from a behavioral
Help Controlling the No Reason Laugh

perspective is is one of those tactics where our kids kind of delay things they

just want to delay but more often my experience has been that it is yeast

related and it has Ive seen that believe me a lot and Ive seen a lot of

kids just they look drunk they look like their walk around and theyre just giggling they will smell like brandy

sometimes in their in their mouth or their heads or their feet will smell like fresh baked bread you can smell the

yeast well you so I would definitely do a rule out of yeast issues which

essentially means that youd want to see a functional medicine physician or a

nutritionist or dietitian and they can help you first of all test for and see if there is excessive yeast thats a

stool test that you can do and and once you know that then treat the yeast

because yeast candidiasis in general does tend to be a big issue with a lot

of our kids fungal infections so that would be very important to do and if its not that the other thing that I

sometimes see is our kids remember something that theyve seen on a TV show

or whatever and with our with typically developing kids they also do but the difference is they will say ah I just

remembered blah blah blah and theyll give an introduction to what it is theyre thinking and our kids dont give

that introduction so the first thing is if its like random times and it doesnt

appear to be necessarily connected to something theyve seen before then I

would really go for treating the yeast figuring out if it is yeast but if it does appear that oh this shot your child

often laughs also when they see particular segment and they repeat that segment then it just could be that

theyre remembering something funny and they just dont know how to say it or introduce that yeah so true I want to

get to some of these last comments Renee and Elvira said last month I moved to a new city seeking more resources and

better school we started seeing a Maps doctor good for you and Im so thankful for everything but Im so overwhelmed

how do moms do this Im sending you a hug and telling you that you know we all have had moments where we thought we
Feeling Overwhelmed with New School and Resources in a New City

couldnt do it yeah for me personally I tried to give myself shortterm reinforcers and longterm reinforcers

Ive said many times before in the show that on my darkest days I would always picture my son standing in front of me

in a cap and gown and that I would be able to say to him we did everything that we could the world is yours now and

I got to do that two years ago I stood with him at graduation and did that now I have different pictures in my head

yeah that help me to get through things but that wasnt enough I had to have shortterm reinforcers and I would try

to check in I had like a yearly thing that we would do and I would think oh my gosh you know were so much better than

we were a year ago because because its hard and you have to have you know

friends and people around you yeah and and people to fill your bucket to to

inspire you more but its hard its very very very hard and I want to say just

you know for a moment for parents whos who dont get to enjoy the longterm

reinforced service child doesnt get to graduation I want you to remember that

to begin with youre a different category than the parent of the typical

child and thats important because youre not so you know I think of all

parents of kids its a hard thing anyway but some some of us are sitting in the

village and were dealing with you know making the village a more livable place

and some of us are on the front lines and youre youre the Warriors youre

the people who are were given this task and dont dont mistake your job is

never going to be as easy as the job of a neurotypical childs parents its just

not its a different job and its a harder job theres no question at least

for now when theyre a child you never know with neurotypical kids I mean you know a lot of parents of neurotypical

kids deal with very very significant issues when their child is a teenager or

who knows when an illness might attack or whatever it is we all have those things but your job at least in the

beginning is a tougher job you are the warrior thats you have been given that

task and you can do this you are going to get through this there are other parents like you who have you dont have

to be perfect at it you do the best you you can and it just is part of the job

you know what I mean a lot of times I think as parents we get tired and we just want to throw the towel in and you

can throw the towel in for a day or two but the fact of the matter is and you can get help and so on but I I think

parents and I always say this because parents are the reason I stay in this field for so many years you are warriors

youre Warriors thats who you are and the sooner you recognize that the better

because youre going to continue to be a warrior even if your child recovers youre a warrior like Shannon who will

now influence other peoples lives in one way or another so put on the warrior hat and itll remind

you that you can do it yes I always like the equation strength over time equals

power there you go so you dont have to get it perfect today you dont have to do everything today exhibit strength

over time yep there we go were out of time but I just want to say johani you wrote a great question about

how do we teach different reinforcers Im going to put that at the top of the list for next week and Felix asked how

can we get a consultation with you Dr Doreen for our son you can write directly to me Shannon at autism

hyphenlivecom and I will forward that to her assistant Shannon at autism

hyphenlivecom and Ill afford it dark angel wrote a question about pronunciation that I think is important
